# Formation Classifier Using Machine Learning

This project uses well log data to classify subsurface formations. So far, the model has achieved **100% accuracy** on clean sandstone and shale zones.

## Whatâ€™s Inside:
- A Jupyter notebook with all preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps
- A single log file used for training
- Ongoing work to include more formations and test on new data

## Tools Used:
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Future Plans:
- Expand to multiclass classification (limestone, siltstone, etc.)
- Deploy as a web app or API for automated classification
